# sudoku
I made this project for solving sudoku's
        tooling used:
           * maven
           * spring boot, with controller sending and receiving json
           * angularjs for presentation and getting posting data to the server
           * resource file containing all unsolved sudoku's
           * some common sence for solving sudokus
